# Hello Windows
Notes self on creating a developer environment for myself in Windows 10.

This is primarily for setting up a dev environment for Java, MySQL, MariaDB.

### git
	0. Navigate to [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win) for the Windows version of Git.
	1. Launch the .exe file after download and select your preferences/install.
	2. Open Git Bash after the installation is complete. I also recommend pinning it to the taskbar.
	3. Set up your github credentials using:
		`git config --global user.name "Your Name" && git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`
	4. When pushing your first commit, you will be asked to enter your github credentials.
